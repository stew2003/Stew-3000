Hardware
  [] implement sign flag and signed overflow flag (Stewart)
  [x] implement dream instruction set in microcode (Stewart)
  [x] get the RAM loader working (Stewart)

Assembler
  [x] model our instr set with OCaml datatypes. will be used by assembler,
    compiler, and virtual machine
  [x] think about how to implement labels
  [x] implement assembler
  [x] maybe switch from hashtable to different map
  [x] reconsider how we validate immediates: currently prevents you
    from writing an immediate that is a mem loc >127

Compiler
  [] decide on language constructs
  [] implement compiler
  [] implement optimizations for smol code

Virtual Machine
  [x] software simulation of the stew3000, for compiler testing
  [] add flag for levels of verbose output:
    default: no output, final state printed
    1) out instructions print their output
    2) current instruction is printed
    3) full state is printed at each instruction

[] document everything
