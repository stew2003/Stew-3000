Hardware
  [x] Fix stack memory
  [x] Fix ram loader
  [x] Add Zero register
  [] New instructions (see microcode README)

Assembler
  [x] change instr type to match new ISA

Compiler
  [] implement optimizations for smol code
    Pre-compile: 
      [x] constant folding 
        [] consider what happens on overflow
      [] omit (+warn) unused vars and functions
      [] omit (+warn) dead code
    During compile:
      [x] special-case compilation of conditions (if/while)
      [] use more immediate instructions to reduce stack instructions
      [] var == 0 is same as !var 
      [] "compile to" given register (reduce movs)
    Post-compile:
      [x] eliminate redundant instrs
      [x] replace addi 1, _ / subi 1, _ with inr/dcr
      [x] remove addi 0, subi 0, etc (no effect)

Docs
  [] document everything
