Hardware
  [] debug new instruction set

Compiler
  [] implement optimizations for smol code
    Pre-compile: 
      [x] constant folding 
        [] consider what happens on overflow
      [] omit (+warn) unused vars and functions
      [] omit (+warn) dead code
    During compile:
      [] use more immediate instructions to reduce stack instructions

Docs
  [] document everything
